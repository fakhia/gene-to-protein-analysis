Key Tasks and Outputs:

Sequence Retrieval & Translation

Fetched Homo sapiens TRPV6 gene (RefSeq NM_018646.6) DNA and protein sequences using NCBI Entrez via BioPython.

Verified sequence integrity and performed translation to amino acid sequence.

Output: TRPV6 DNA (2906 bp) and protein (51 aa) sequences.

Codon Usage Profiling & Visualization

Computed codon frequency distribution and visualized codon usage trends using Matplotlib.

Output: codon_usage_trpv6.csv, codon_usage_plot.png.

Comparative Codon Usage Analysis (Human vs Mouse)

Conducted cross-species codon usage comparison between Homo sapiens (NM_018646.6) and Mus musculus TRPV6 genes.

Generated RSCU (Relative Synonymous Codon Usage) heatmaps to visualize evolutionary and translational patterns.

Output: trpv6_codon_compare_human_mouse.csv, codon_freq_compare.png, rscu_compare.png.

Codon Bias Metrics Calculation

Computed gene-level metrics: GC3 (43.6%), Effective Number of Codons (ENC ≈ 21.7), and Codon Adaptation Index (CAI ≈ 0.75).

Interpreted results in relation to TRPV6’s high translational efficiency and potential overexpression in cancer biology.

Output: trpv6_codon_metrics_table.csv, trpv6_codon_summary_metrics.csv.

Codon Bias vs. Protein Expression Correlation

Analyzed the relationship between codon usage bias and protein expression efficiency in membrane transporters.

Highlighted TRPV6’s codon optimization as a factor contributing to efficient expression and calcium ion channel function.
